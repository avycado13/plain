# plain.password

Password authentication for Plain.

## Usage

To enable password authentication in your Plain application, add the `PasswordLoginView` to your `urls.py`:

```python
# app/urls.py
from plain.urls import path
from plain.passwords.views import PasswordLoginView

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', PasswordLoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
    # ...
]
```

This sets up a basic login view where users can authenticate using their username and password.
