## Local development - opinions

One of my original goals in extending Django was to build a complete local development experience.
What's the single command that gets my project up and running locally?

At one point I tried to use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for this,
but even I am not old enough to care to learn how tmux works.

After that I built `forge-work`, which automatically detected which processes you needed and ran them using [Honcho](https://honcho.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
This became `bolt work`.

### Removed runsever

### `bolt work`

rename to dev?
