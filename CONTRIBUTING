# Contributing to Plain

First of all, there's more than one way to contribute to Plain. [Sharing the project on social media](https://x.com/plainframework), or [starring it on GitHub](https://github.com/dropseed/plain), are surprisingly helpful things that anyone can do!

For more technical contributions, please [open an issue for well-identified bugs](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/issues), and a [discussion for anything else](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/discussions). Don't waste your time working on a lengthy PR with the _hope_ that it will be merged! Writing the code is often the easy part â€” deciding how to do something, or whether to do it at all, is harder and more important.
